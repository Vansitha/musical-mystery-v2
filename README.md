## About

Guess the correct song among three options within a time limit to earn points. Each player starts with 3 lives. A correct guess scores you 10 points, but failing to guess in time or making an incorrect guess results in losing 1 life point. Aim to gain as many points as possible to secure a spot on the leaderboard.

Built as a fun little side project

### Why did I build this?

I thought it'd be a cool and fun side project, so I took the idea and loosely designed it in Figma (Not really a UI UX person). Version 1 was built while I was learning React [[Check it out]](https://github.com/Vansitha/musical-mystery). I faced some issues and learned from pitfalls. Now, I've revamped the UI and created a new version with a better structure. Open to feedback and suggestions for improvements! ðŸ˜„

v2.0
